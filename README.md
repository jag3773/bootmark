# bootmark

> for your markdown needs n stuff

originally a fork of strapdown but a lot more extended:
- external files
- all bootswatch themes (bootstrap 3)
- optional automatic table of content
- showdown parser (which is alot more capable than marked)
- it's still a work in progress and im open to suggestions

in the [demo](https://obedm503.github.io/bootmark/?fetch=README.md) you can:
- try a different theme by adding to the url:
  - ``?theme=<any bootswatch theme>``
  - [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com)
  - default theme for the demo is yeti
- try with a different markdown file by adding to the url:
  - ``?fetch=<any public markdown file>``
  - default file is the bootstrap readme on github
- try without a table of contents by adding to the url:
  - ``?toc=false``
