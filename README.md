## bootmark

> for your markdown needs n stuff

see the docs [here](./docs/index.html)

see examples [here](./examples/index.html)

originally a fork of strapdown but a lot more extended:
- external files
- all bootswatch themes (bootstrap 3)
- optional automatic table of content
- showdown parser
- it's still a work in progress and i'm open to ideas

in the [demo](https://obedm503.github.io/bootmark/) you can:
- try a different theme by adding to the url:
  - ``?theme=<any bootswatch theme>``
  - [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com)
  - default theme for the demo is yeti
- try with a different markdown file by adding to the url:
  - showdown's readme ``?fetch=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/showdownjs/showdown/master/README.md``
  - bootstrap's readme ``?fetch=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twbs/bootstrap/master/README.md``
- try without a table of contents by adding to the url:
  - ``?toc=false``
